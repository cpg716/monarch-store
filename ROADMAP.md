# MonARCH Store Roadmap 🗺️

This document outlines the planned trajectory for MonARCH Store. As an alpha-stage project, our focus is on building a rock-solid, host-adaptive foundation first.

---

## 🚀 Current Milestone: v0.4.x (The Host-Adaptive Foundation)
*   [x] **Mission Control**: Full settings overhaul for source and builder management.
*   [x] **Unified Update Engine**: Parallel checks for ALPM, AUR, and Flatpak.
*   [x] **Sanitary Audit**: Removal of legacy "Ghost Commands" and tech debt.
*   [x] **Built from Source**: Clear UX indicators for AUR compilation.

---

## 🔜 Phase 1: Refining the Experience (Short-term)
*   [ ] **Theming Engine 2.0**: Deeper integration of system accents into the UI.
*   [ ] **Advanced AUR Dependency Solver**: Native resolution of complex AUR dependency trees without external wrappers.
*   [ ] **AppStream Review Integration**: Seamlessly read and write ODRS/Flathub reviews.
*   [ ] **Flatpak Theming**: Automatically syncing system GTK/KDE themes to Flatpak containers.

---

## 🔭 Phase 2: Power Tools (Mid-term)
*   [ ] **Snapshot & Rollback**: Integration with Btrfs/Timeshift to "Undo" an installation.
*   [ ] **App List Backup**: Export as a simple JSON/Bash script to replicate your setup on a new machine.
*   [ ] **Mirror Ranking Pro**: Active latency checking during large package downloads.
*   [ ] **Plug-in Architecture**: Allow community-built "hooks" into the install process.

---

## 🌠 Phase 3: Expansion (Long-term)
*   [ ] **MonARCH Hub**: A community-driven discovery portal with curated "Collections".
*   [ ] **Mobile Layout**: Responsive UI refinements for devices like the PinePhone or Steam Deck.
*   [ ] **Multi-Distro Support**: Investigating support for Fedora (DNF) or Nix (though our heart remains in Arch).

*Note: This roadmap is subject to change based on community feedback and core development priorities.*
