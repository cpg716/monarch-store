# 🦋 MonARCH Store

**A modern, premium software store for Arch Linux, built with Tauri v2, React, and Rust.**

MonARCH Store is designed to make package management on Arch-based systems (Arch, EndeavourOS, CachyOS, Garuda, etc.) beautiful, fast, and accessible. It unifies **Official Distribution Repositories**, **AUR**, and **Chaotic-AUR** into a single, cohesive experience.

## ☁️ Backend Configuration (Optional)

To enable **Community Reviews**, you need to connect your own Supabase instance.
*By default, the app uses read-only public keys. To host your own:*

1.  Create a **Supabase** project.
2.  Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:
    ```sql
    create table reviews (
      id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
      package_name text not null,
      user_name text not null default 'Anonymous',
      rating int not null check (rating >= 1 and rating <= 5),
      comment text,
      created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now()) not null
    );
    alter table reviews enable row level security;
    create policy "Public Read" on reviews for select using (true);
    create policy "Public Insert" on reviews for insert with check (true);
    ```
3.  Update `src/services/reviewService.ts` with your **Project URL** and **Anon Key**.
